# Demon Hacks - Social Awareness!

The world as it is right now, faces issues like water deprivation, famine, illiteracy, lack of sanitation, etc. People are deprived of even the basic rights. We wanted to make a system that focuses on the most important issues that the world is facing and we intend to direct donations there.

We used a choropleth map to show the data. We also used Algolia to search for any countries that the user might be interested to know about, to generate a donut chart about it.

While working with data about the top 30 countries facing water deprivation, famine, illiteracy and lack of sanitation, we made a discovery that only a handful of countries are facing all or most of these issues. So shouldn't our funds be directed towards those who are most needy?
